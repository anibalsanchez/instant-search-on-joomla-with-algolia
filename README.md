# InstantSearch on Joomla with Algolia

In this talk, we are going to review several techniques that are currently powering the search of content on Joomla. In particular, we are going to focus the presentation on the latest advances in the search area, powered by Algolia. Algolia is a hosted full-text, numerical, and faceted search engine capable of delivering real-time results from the first keystroke. Algolia delivers products to accelerate search and discovery experiences across any device and platform. To show the capabilities of the platform, we are going to configure XT Search for Algolia and the Algolia service on a brand new Joomla site to present how quickly Autocompletion and InstantSearch can be implemented.
